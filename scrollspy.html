    <div id="home">Lomography is the commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, Austria for products and services catering to lo-fi photographers. The name is inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia. LOMO PLC created and produced the 35mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera — which became the centerpiece of Lomography’s marketing and sales activities. This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s. In 1991, the Austrian founders of Lomography discovered the Lomo LC-A. They were “charmed by the unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry” images that the camera produced. After a series of international art exhibitions and marketing, Lomography signed an exclusive distribution agreement with LOMO PLC — thereby becoming the sole distributor of all Lomo LC-A cameras outside of the Soviet Union. Since the introduction of the original Lomo LC-A, Lomography has produced and marketed various lines of branded analogue cameras. Most of these cameras are designed to produce a single photographic effect. In 2005, production of the original Lomo LC-A was discontinued. Its replacement, the LC-A+, was introduced in Fall 2006. The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC. This changed as of mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well. Similar to Eastman Kodak’s concept of the “Kodak moment”, the Lomography website endorses a motto of “Don’t Think, Just Shoot”. This motto is accompanied by the Ten Golden Rules of Lomography; guidelines encouraging spontaneity and minimal consideration of formal technique. The cameras marketed by Lomography are generally low-fidelity and inexpensively constructed. Some cameras make use of multiple lenses and colored flashes, or exhibit optical distortions and light leaks. Current models marketed by Lomographische AG include Lomo LC-A, Diana, Holga, Holga 35mm, Actionsampler, Frogeye, Pop-9, Oktomat, Fisheye, </div>
    <div id="about">When i try to paste a large amount of text, about 300,000 lines, onto google sites or google drive, the tab freezes and i have to close it out. Is there a way to paste the text without it breaking? I could paste it in sections, but i'm not sure how to select the document in sections, and click+scroll would take forever.

When you mean "click and scroll", can I assume you mean, click, hold the button down, and drag to select, where it scrolls automatically scrolls when you get to the bottom of the page?

Instead try clicking to put the cursor at the beginning of the document, then hold the shift key and click where you want to select to. (If its a web page where you can't place a cursor, select the first word only, then hold SHIFT and click the last word you want to select. Everything in-between will be selected as well. Much faster than click-hold-drag because you can use the scrollbar to quickly go to (for example) the 1/3 position in the document to copy just the first third.

(Alternatively, try a different browser if the one you're using can't handle pasting a lot of text).

Telling us your OS and what browser you're using would help too ;-)

Keep in mind that there's a default limit to what you can put into the Clipboard (Window's temp space for copy and pasting). This isn't so much an issue any more in Windows 7 (64 bit), but it may still be an issue in 32-bit versions. Using something other than the default Clipboard manager might get you some better results:</div>
